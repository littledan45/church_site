                <p>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
                    Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
                    Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
                    But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
                    likeness of men:
                    And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
                    death of the cross.
                    Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
                    That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
                    things under the earth;
                    And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
                    Father. Philippians 2:4-11
                </p>
                <p>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:11</p>
